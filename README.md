# CMD-auto

This a programm that restart an appliacation by killing the .exe task then restarting it automatically, thus no need to write a bash file to set up such a command.
The .cpp file is in the CMD folder. If you want to open the whole configuration in Visual Studion, open the .sln file and change it if you want.
